Phase-1(JavaScript)-Week-2-Code Challenge
Date: 29 March 2024
By: George Kahugu

## Description-
   Below are the three code- challenges tackled with my own output examples;

   ### Challenge 1;
    This is a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example, if you input 'The Boy Is Headed To School' the output should be 'tHE bOY iS hEADED tO sCHOOL'.
    
   ### Challenge 2;
    This is a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 2 and 8, the output should be [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and -2 and 8 should return [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8].
    
 ### Challenge 3;
    This is a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. This function would be prompted efficiently, ensuring that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array. For example, if you provide an array [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] it should return an array [11, 13, 15, 17].
